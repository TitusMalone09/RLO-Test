# RLO-Test
An experimental test of the functions of Unicode character 202E, and the dangers Right-to-Left Override can cause in security.

Unicode character 202E is designed so that any characters typed after it appear from right to left instead of left to right. For example. typing "abc[202E]abc" would make the text appear as "abccba" instead. This is dangerous in the area security, as hackers can use this technique to switch around how file extensions appear to trick users, even those with file extensions on! The attached file (see Releases) is an executable named exactly "TestFileForNotepad.[202E]txt.exe" but RLO makes it appear as "TestFileForNotepad.txt.exe"; this illustrates the danger of Right-to-Left Override. The file also has the icon of a .txt file. It will likely be flagged as a virus, which is fine, since it is a demonstration of a virus's function; but running it will only create a .txt file on your Desktop containing the string "HAHAHA."
